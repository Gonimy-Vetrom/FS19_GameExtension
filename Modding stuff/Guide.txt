___ Overrides ___

	Give the option of stopping overrides which Game Extension does.
	Preferable set this in loadMap() function, any later will render it useless.
	
	Note:
	Keep in mind by stopping an override it is adviced to disable the setting which is linked to it, read the next chapter (Disable Setting).
	
	-- Code Example --
	if g_gameExtension ~= nil then
		g_gameExtension.OVERRIDE_VEHICLE_FILLLEVEL = true;
	end;
	
	-- List of overrides --		
		Name						- Overridden function
		OVERRIDE_SAVE_GAME			- SavegameController.onSaveComplete
		OVERRIDE_SHOW_PLAYERNAME	- Player.drawUIInfo

___ Disable Module ___
	
	This will stop everything which is linked to this module such as setting or objects from being called, shown or saved.
	Call in load function, all mods are loaded by then and its safe to deactivate modules.

	-- Code Example --
	if g_gameExtension ~= nil then
		g_gameExtension:deactivateModule("PLAYER", g_currentModName); 
	end;


___ Disable Setting ___
	
	Give the option to change the state of an setting or module which change how they will function in the game
	
	g_gameExtension.BL_STATE_NORMAL 	 	= 0; -- Normal
	g_gameExtension.BL_STATE_DONT_SHOW   	= 1; -- Don't show in gui, will save
	g_gameExtension.BL_STATE_NOTHING 		= 2; -- Won't show or save setting, Default
	
	g_gameExtension:disableSettingForMod(MOD, SETTING or MODULE NAME, BLACKLIST STATE (Optional))
	
	-- Code Example --
	if g_gameExtension ~= nil then
		g_gameExtension:disableSettingForMod("ZZZ_driveControl", "DC_USE_SHUTTLE", g_gameExtension.BL_STATE_DONT_SHOW);
	end;
